WEEKELY MEETING TIME:

Friday 13:00 in CSIT foyer

ROLES: (to be updated once we have a better idea of the task, or a third member joins the group)

During wk 5 both gorup members will revise/practice their Java programing, as well as their understanding of UML.
We will work on our UML diagram together on Friday 14th  August.

Xavier will look at the assignment and try to find a way to equally divide the workload.
If it turns out different parts of the assignment can't be done in paralell we'll work something
else out in terms of roles.
