I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method minimalPath() in class HexGame().
* The method movePiece() and it's reccursive cousin in class HexGameGUI().

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

Several animations in HexGameGUI use code adapted from examples in the Java documentation:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/Transition.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/PathTransition.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/FadeTransition.html

Code for click-and-drag functionality was adapted from Steve Blackburn's X02 Lecture given this semester
