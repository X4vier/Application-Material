I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage E of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

Several animations in HexGameGUI use code adapted from examples in the Java documentation:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/Transition.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/PathTransition.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/FadeTransition.html

Code for click-and-drag functionality was adapted from Steve Blackburn's X02 Lecture given this semester
