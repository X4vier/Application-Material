I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method PlaySound1() in class HexGameGUI.
* The method ActionEvent in class Music.


I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

The sound files in class <HexGameGUI> uses <http://www.soundjay.com/button-sounds-2.html>
The icons in class <Music> uses <http://www.iconarchive.com/tag/media-button>
