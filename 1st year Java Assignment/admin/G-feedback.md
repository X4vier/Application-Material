### Final mark:  11/11

### Comments:

Your program has come together very well. It is well structured and you have broken it
down into many classes and objects that make sense. However there are several files that
have been left uncommented that could have done with minor explanation.

Some great extensions and a good use of unit testing. Well done!

**Key:  'Y' - yes, 'N' - no, '~' - partial compliance**

Y Authorship of each class needs to be clearly stated in a comment of each class. (Note: 'authorship details' is fairly open-ended. It may mean stating that the code was written by the group, or by one or two members, or that it was heavily adapted from some third party. Either way, it should be absolutely clear to the reader which person or persons were responsible for the code and the ideas behind it.).
Y Git logs must indicate appropriate use of version control.
Y The program must compile and run (from the .jar file).
